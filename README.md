# ☕ Coffee Orders Dashboard

This project features a simple Excel dashboard built to analyze coffee order data. It was created as part of my data analytics portfolio to demonstrate foundational Excel skills, including data transformation, lookup functions, and interactive dashboard design.

## 📊 Dashboard Overview

The dashboard answers three key business questions:

- ✅ **What are the total sales?**
- 🧍‍♂️ **Who are the top 5 customers by sales?**
- 🌍 **How are sales distributed by country?**

The design includes Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, and interactive elements such as slicers and a timeline to make the insights easily explorable.
